This repository contains the full source code and documentation for a real-time, multi-sensor environmental data logger built on an **STM32F767ZI Nucleo** board using the **FreeRTOS** operating system.

The system concurrently reads data from a **DHT11** (temperature/humidity) and a **capacitive soil moisture sensor**, processes the data for accuracy, and displays it on a **graphical OLED screen**. This project is a comprehensive example of a real-world embedded system, covering hardware interfacing, custom driver development, RTOS architecture, and a polished user interface.

## üîë Key Features

- **Real-Time & Multitasking**  
  Built on FreeRTOS with a pre-emptive scheduler, featuring two concurrent tasks for sensing and display that communicate safely using a **message queue** and **mutex**.

- **Robust Sensor Drivers**  
  Includes a custom, RTOS-aware driver for the DHT11 with a pre-scheduler "cranking" routine to handle hardware instability and a context-aware critical section to protect timing from RTOS interrupts.

- **Advanced Data Filtering**  
  Uses **ADC oversampling** to reduce noise from the analog soil sensor and applies a **linear mapping function** with user-calibrated values for accurate percentage readings.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
  A clean, professional UI on an SH1106 OLED display using the **U8g2 library**, featuring a **startup splash screen** and **graphical progress bars**.

- **System Status Indicators**  
  Utilizes the onboard LEDs to provide at-a-glance feedback: a **blinking/solid blue LED** for the DHT11's startup status and a **green LED** that serves as a "soil is dry" warning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system architecture is designed around two main tasks:

- **`sensorTask`**  
  This task runs periodically every two seconds. It reads the raw sensor values, applies **oversampling** and **calibration logic**, and then sends the final, processed data to a **message queue**.

- **`displayTask`**  
  This task is **event-driven**. It waits for data to arrive in the message queue, and upon receiving it, it takes control of the I2C bus via a **mutex** to update the **OLED display** with the new information.

This **decoupled design** ensures that the sensor reading and display updates operate independently, creating a **responsive and stable system**.
